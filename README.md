# Modular key holder
Modular key holder box with wall mounting holes and 4x slots for customizable modules.
![hanged on wall]

Wanted a nice looking key holder box that could easily be used for smart home projects or modified after being placed on the wall.
Achieved that by making modules with 4 5x2 mm rounded magnets.
Designed to be hanged on existing screws.

# Instructions
1. If you want to make a custom module for your need simply edit the blank.step from the CAD folder.
2. Printing: I recommend putting a G-CODE stop inside the slicer to the point where the hole for the magnet is printed but it's still not closed off.
Or you can just manually look and stop it when you see it's at that point.
